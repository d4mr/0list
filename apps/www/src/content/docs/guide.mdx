# What is 0list?

0list is a self-hosted waitlist system that runs entirely on Cloudflare's infrastructure. It lets you collect signups for your product launch, beta program, or any other waitlist scenario.

## Why 0list?

**The problem**: You're launching something and need to collect emails. You could use a SaaS waitlist tool (monthly fees, data on someone else's servers) or build something yourself (time-consuming, another thing to maintain).

**The solution**: 0list gives you a fully-featured waitlist system that:

- **Costs almost nothing** - Runs on Cloudflare's generous free tier
- **You own your data** - Everything lives in your Cloudflare account
- **Works globally** - Deploys to 300+ edge locations worldwide
- **Takes minutes to deploy** - Not hours or days

## How It Works

The flow is simple:

<Steps>
  <div>
    ### User signs up

    Someone visits your landing page and submits their email (and any custom fields you've configured). Your form sends a POST request to your 0list API.
  </div>

  <div>
    ### 0list stores the signup

    The API validates the email, checks for duplicates, and saves the signup to your D1 database. If you've enabled double opt-in, it sends a confirmation email.
  </div>

  <div>
    ### User confirms (optional)

    If double opt-in is enabled, the user clicks the link in their confirmation email. Their signup is marked as verified.
  </div>

  <div>
    ### You manage signups

    Log into your admin dashboard to see everyone who signed up. Search, filter, export to CSV, or invite users when you're ready to launch.
  </div>
</Steps>

## The Three Parts

### The API

A REST endpoint that handles signups. You integrate this with your landing page:

<CodeBlock
  lang="javascript"
  code={`fetch('https://your-worker.workers.dev/api/waitlists/my-product/signup', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ email: 'user@example.com' })
})`}
/>

The API validates emails, prevents duplicates, and optionally sends confirmation emails.

### The Admin Dashboard

A web interface for managing everything:

- **Create waitlists** - Different lists for different products or launches
- **View signups** - See who signed up, when, and their verification status
- **Search & filter** - Find specific users or segments
- **Export data** - Download CSVs for importing elsewhere
- **Configure settings** - Branding, custom fields, email templates

### The Database

Cloudflare D1 stores all your data - waitlist configs, signups, verification tokens. You never touch SQL directly; the dashboard handles everything.

## What Can You Customize?

| Feature | What You Can Do |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Branding** | Primary color for emails and embeds |
| **Custom Fields** | Collect more than just email (name, company, etc.) |
| **Double Opt-in** | Require email verification |
| **Email Templates** | Customize confirmation and welcome emails |
| **CORS Origins** | Control which domains can submit signups |

## Typical Use Cases

- **Product launches** - "Sign up for early access"
- **Beta programs** - "Join the beta waitlist"
- **Newsletter signups** - Simple email collection
- **Event registration** - Collect attendee info
- **Feature announcements** - "Get notified when X ships"

## Tech Stack

For the curious: Cloudflare Workers for the runtime, D1 for the database, Hono for the API framework, React for the dashboard, and Cloudflare Access for authentication.
