# Branding

Customize the look and feel of your waitlist.

## Overview

Each waitlist can have its own branding settings that apply to:

- Confirmation and welcome emails
- Redirect pages (success/error)
- Admin dashboard appearance

---

## Email Branding

Customize how emails appear to your users.

### Sender Identity

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **From Name** | Name shown in recipient's inbox (e.g., "Acme Inc") |
| **From Email** | Must be a verified domain in Resend |
| **Reply-To** | Where replies are sent (can differ from From) |

### Visual Branding

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Logo URL** | Full URL to your logo image (recommended: 200x50px) |
| **Primary Color** | Hex color for buttons and links (e.g., `#4F46E5`) |
| **Company Name** | Shown in email footer |

<CodeBlock
  title="Example Configuration"
  lang="json"
  code={`{
  "fromName": "Acme Inc",
  "fromEmail": "hello@acme.com",
  "replyTo": "support@acme.com",
  "logoUrl": "https://acme.com/logo.png",
  "primaryColor": "#4F46E5",
  "companyName": "Acme Inc"
}`}
/>

---

## Redirect Pages

After email confirmation, users are redirected to custom URLs.

### Success Redirect

Where users go after successful email confirmation. You can include the position in the URL:

```
https://yoursite.com/waitlist/success?position={{position}}
```

### Error Redirect

Where users go if confirmation fails (expired/invalid token):

```
https://yoursite.com/waitlist/error
```

<Callout type="tip">
  Create dedicated landing pages for these redirects to maintain a consistent experience.
</Callout>

---

## Domain Customization

By default, your API runs on `your-worker.workers.dev`. For a professional appearance:

1. Add a custom domain to your Cloudflare Worker
2. Update your frontend to use the custom domain
3. Update email templates to use the custom domain for confirmation links

<Callout type="info">
  Custom domains require the domain to be on Cloudflare DNS (free).
</Callout>

## Multi-Waitlist Branding

If you run multiple waitlists, each can have completely independent branding:

| Waitlist | Brand | Domain |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Product A Beta | Acme Blue | `waitlist.acme.com` |
| Product B Launch | Acme Green | `signup.productb.com` |
| Internal Survey | Corporate | `internal.acme.com` |

Configure each waitlist's branding in its **Settings** → **Email** tab.

## Best Practices

- **Use a verified domain** — Improves email deliverability
- **Match your brand colors** — Consistency builds trust
- **Include a logo** — Makes emails instantly recognizable
- **Set a reply-to address** — So users can respond if needed
- **Create custom redirect pages** — Don't send users to a generic page
